### Motif Discovery

- Refers to a non-trivial **sequential pattern**, shared across multiple sequences
- Main feature: recurrence (occurs in several of the analyzed sequences)
- Relevance of a motif arises when the set of sequences, where it occurs are associated to genomic elements 
  - such as genes
    - that share a certain biological property
    - are under the same regulatory control

- They can occur:
  - In the <code>promoter</code> region of genes, indicating the presence of **binding sites** of single proteins or protein complexes that have a regulatory role in gene transcription. 

- In protein sequences:
  - Motifs may indicate the existence of conserved domains (parts of the protein that play specific biological functions; eg. enzyme binding sites for substrates/other molecules)

- Type groups of motifs:
  - <code>deterministic</code>
  - <code>probabilistic</code>

- Deterministic motifs:
  - Often captured by enhanced RE
  - As name indicates; present/absent in the input sequences
